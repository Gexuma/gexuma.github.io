	<h1>Gexuma</h1>
	<h2>Me, online.</h2>
	<p>I do a lot of things online, including meeting my beautiful wife Geneva! She's everything to me... Despite always being online, I find it a tad weird to be referred to as "Gexuma", though. Most people I talk to seem to naturally gravitate to using "Gex" instead, which is a bit more normal, but it's still odd. Really I find any name for me odd when I reflect on it for any length of time. I'm me, I guess.</p>
	<p>I edit videos <a href="https://ko-fi.com/gexuma/" class="line">(commission me go on you know you want to)</a>, mess around in Photoshop, and write things.<a class="footnote"><sup>1</sup><span>mostly for university</span></a>I'm studying linguistics and anthropology in an "at a university getting a degree with those written on it" way, and I'm interested in international politics,<a class="footnote"><sup>2</sup><span>god do I hate the assessment format for that at my university though</span></a> history, classical studies, urban design and transport,<a class="footnote"><sup>3</sup><span>this is really just a nice way of saying I deeply dislike car travel...</span></a> and above everything else, or perhaps encapsulating my interest in everything else, people! Gosh people are nice.</p>
	<p>Uen I'm talqing to my friends online, I often write liqe this. The W qey on my main qeyboard broqe a uile ago<a class="footnote"><sup>4</sup><span>very bad uen you play a lot of games requiring it</span></a> and this uas the solution I chose. My K qey is fine, thanqs for asqing. It's just fun to use lots of Qs too.<a class="footnote"><sup>5</sup><span>It's harder to type uithout doing this than it is to type doing this at this point</span></a> (Unfortunately I no longer do this! It was fun but got so deeply ingrained that I would do it when writing essays.)</p>
	<p>I apologise if this is not the sort of "about me" page you were expecting or wanting! Perhaps <a class="line" href="../aboutmore">this</a> might be more to your liking?</p>
