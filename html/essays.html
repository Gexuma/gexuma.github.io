					<h2>On Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</h2>
					<h3>Directed by Hayao Miyazaki<br>1984</h3>
					<p>
						Apocalyptic and dystopian films are now exceedingly common and over-done, with grim themes heaped on with no real narrative purpose. Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind does the opposite of this, showing a section of peace in a post-apocalyptic world, as well as gradually taking away the alien terror of the initial largest threats, and I think this makes it particularly noteworthy. While most love it for its amazingly detailed animation and artwork, I think the story and worldbuilding is equally impressive. Directed and written by Hayao Miyazaki, now of Studio Ghibli fame, it is regarded as one of the greatest animated films of all time, a title well earned. Miyazaki tells the story of Princess Nausicaä, who unwittingly gets pulled into conflict between global superpowers after a cargo plane carrying a thousand-year-old bioweapon crashes in the valley of her people. The military state of Tolmekia subsequently invade the valley, killing several people and seizing the bioweapon, who we discover to be a Giant Warrior, the last of those that caused the Seven Days of Fire that put the world into its current state. The Seven Days of Fire created the Sea of Decay, a vast and alien jungle ecosystem. It is toxic for people to enter this forest, but it turns out this is not because of the plants, but because of the radiation contaminated soil they grow on. Many giant insects live in this jungle, most notably the Ohms, massive arthropods reminiscent of trilobites. Tolmekia seeks to conquer all countries near them with this Warrior and then burn away the Sea. After taking Nausicaä and multiple other villagers hostage, a squadron returns to Tolmekia to hand in the valley’s confiscated planes. This squadron is attacked by a Pejite fighter aircraft (one of the nations Tolmekia has invaded) and the squadron is decimated, leaving only a light aircraft left in the hanger that Nausicaä escapes on, as well as a towed plane with the rest of the villagers on board dropping towards the Sea of Decay. They manage to land safely, using gas masks to breathe, but Nausicaä hears the crash of the Pejite plane and runs off with a glider to help. This eventually leads to her and the occupant of the aircraft crashing through the forest floor, where they find it is held up by ancient trees. These trees and the forest above them are part of what is implied to be a bioengineered ecosystem which is slowly cleansing the Earth of radiation. After managing to get to Pejite, Nausicaä discovers that Pejite rebels have incited the Ohms to attack the Valley of the Winds so that the Giant Warrior can be seized and used to defend Pejite and destroy the Sea of Decay. Fearful for her valley and now knowing the purpose of the Sea, Nausicaä rushes to stop the attack. She succeeds by throwing herself with the wounded juvenile Ohm used as bait in front of the herd of charging Ohms.</p><p>
						The most obvious theme central to this film is the conflict between people and the environment. The actions of civilisations in the past have led to the Earth being polluted with radiation and its cities reduced to ashes. They then sought to remedy this by creating the Sea of Decay. Modern civilisations now seek to destroy their own protections out of ignorance and the worry that the sea will spread and consume them, unaware that this is its positive purpose. Obaba, an old wise woman who lives in the valley, warns the Tolmekian regiment against this, explaining that every time this has been attempted in the past swarms of Ohms have scoured the continent, killing everyone. As we learn, the antagonism between people and the Sea is entirely constructed by humans, as the Ohms only attack when specific rules are broken, despite demonstrating obvious ability to leave the Sea and attack. We also see this in Nausicaä’s flashback halfway through the film that shows the adults of the film taking a baby Ohm she was sheltering away to be killed, because “insects and humans can’t live in the same world.” Nothing the Ohm did indicated aggression, as protested by Nausicaä, who says it isn’t doing anything wrong. This antagonistic mindset built up by the humans has led them to believe that they must continue to kill harmless baby Ohms to survive.</p><p>
						Hayao Miyazaki is warning against tampering with the natural world. All other animals live as part of an interwoven ecosystem, but only humans overstep our bounds and try to subjugate forces we do not understand with consequences we are unsure of. In 1984, climate change was a known phenomenon in the scientific community and portions of the public, but not yet acknowledged by governing bodies until the Kyoto Protocol of 1997. The negative consequences of logging and disruption of other ecosystems for resources were however well known, and it is these that influenced Miyazaki the most. A journal article from 1989 written by Motoko Oyadomari describes nature conservation in Japan as still being in an “embryonic stage”, that is, not yet fully developed.  It is likely that Miyazaki was attempting to draw attention to how similar landscapes were being devastated in our world and was trying to increase popular support for movements to increase environmental protections through his use of such themes in a film that became incredibly popular. This is reflected in its endorsement by the WWF. Miyazaki also directly cited the poisoning of Minamata Bay as an inspiration for the plot of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. Industrial waste was dumped into Minamata Bay throughout the 1950s and 60s, which contained mercury in large amounts. The shellfish of the bay continued to appear outwardly healthy, but they were poisoning those who ate them as mercury accumulated in their system. In this case, as in the film, it wasn’t the environment poisoning people but people poisoning themselves via the environment. The warnings in the film are therefore twofold. Miyazaki is warning us to stop contaminating and disrupting our natural environments, as it can lead later to our deaths, much as we are suffocating ourselves with carbon dioxide. Ecosystems develop methods to deal with contaminants like carbon dioxide, metabolising them and creating a sustainable equilibrium. This is paralleled in the film by the want to use the Giant Warriors again, whose mess is still being cleaned up by natural forces which would not be able to cope with more strain. He is also warning us against plundering these environments for resources and personal gain. This is illustrated by the songs and legends in the film warning against burning away the forest to create more liveable land. Doing this would result in revealing the radiation contaminated land previously being controlled, as well as engaging the Ohms’ defence mechanism, making them devastate the rest of the world. This second warning has such a direct parallel in the real world that I cannot help but think it was the inspiration for part of the film. During the 60s in Brazil, over-crowding and a lack of farmland lead to the Brazilian government looking at the massive expanse of the Amazon rainforest as a fresh opportunity. They subsidised and incentivised the clearing of the forest to be converted into land for crops, seeing that the soil in the rainforest was particularly fertile. After five years of farming, though, the soil became inhospitable dust. This is because the only thing sustaining its fertility was the constant replenishment with rotting vegetation. Without the forest, the soil lacked any basic nutrients, making it worthless for farming. Careless treatment of our ecological resources leads to disaster.</p><p>
						The other large theme of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind is its steadfastly anti-war stance. War in the film is depicted as pointless and needlessly violent, something reflected in Nausicaä’s own opinions on the matter, finding the use of the Ohms by Pejite as awful and the use of the Giant Warrior by Tolmekia as horrifying. The art in the film turns grotesque and gruesome when depicting such actions. The Giant Warrior is grown in a massive slimy egg sac and is consistently fleshy and visceral at every stage of its growth. The Ohms are baited by a tortured-looking juvenile with spikes stuck into it to suspend it from a floating platform. This young Ohm also has blood flowing out of it and makes disturbing crunching noises whenever it tries to move. The methods used in war are universally cruel.</p><p>
						Especially significant are the motivations behind war in Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. While the military leaders of Tolmekia are expansionist and the rebels of Pejite are revengeful, this is not out of a straightforward “evil” with a good side and a bad side being depicted, but instead out of an instinctual fear.  Miyazaki carefully reinforces by depicting not two but four forces in opposition. We see conflict between Pejite, Tolmekia, the Valley of the Wind, and the Sea of Decay, without a straightforward dichotomy. This becomes particularly useful as we get encouraged to sympathise with each in turn. We empathise with the Valley of the Wind from the beginning, of course, but well-placed moments lend the other factors that would be one-dimensional in a more poorly written film increased depth. We learn that Tolmekia’s aggression, at least from Kushana’s perspective, is driven by fear. She has lost an arm to the insects, and implies she has worse hidden wounds, leading her to despise the Sea of Decay and want to remove it so humans can claim the world again. Pejite has been brutally occupied by Tolmekia, so while their want to use the Giant Warrior initially seemed foolhardy, it becomes understandable, and we can see why they would want to attack the valley with Ohms to recover it from Tolmekia. The Sea of Decay itself is built up throughout the course of the film. We are initially charmed by its alien and mysterious introduction, and we learn of the mindset behind the Ohms’ actions. The Valley itself is afraid of the Sea as it could wreck their way of life, and this is shown by displaying the desiccated husk of a town claimed by it. As the viewer, we learn that all the fear and conflict is driven in turn by the fear and conflict first being there. This implies that all war, including that in our world, is needless and self-perpetuating. Were that conflict not to be there, the fear wouldn’t exist either. This attitude is probably driven by the general anti-war climate in a post WWII Japan. Born in 1941 and growing up during the direct aftermath of Imperial Japan’s warlike ambitions and subsequent violent destruction would easily have instilled a hatred of war in Miyazaki that would significantly influence his work. Japan was occupied by approximately 1 million Allied soldiers until 1952, who Miyazaki would inevitably have seen, and experiencing that along with the crash in moral following the cultish ambition of the Empire of Japan presented a strong case against war. Several authors have also postulated a link between the blend of Shinto and Buddhist religion in Japanese spirituality and the themes of Miyazaki’s films. Such philosophies strongly condemn violence as any sort of negotiation method and instead promote compassion, something clearly seen in the failure of the Pejite attacks compared to the often self-sacrificing negotiation tactics of Nausicaä. Another central feature of Buddhism is its opposition to simple classification of “good” and “evil”. Instead, there are three poisons which lead to conflict: greed, ill-will, and delusion. All three are present in the conflict in the film, implying a connection. Demonisation of an opponent is required to push people into supporting violence against that opponent, so Miyazaki shows a plot where that demonisation is ripped away in order to give us a better understanding of conflict. In Buddhism, the concept of “dharma” or suffering is said to be remedied by the counters to the three roots of evil: generosity, loving-kindness, and wisdom. Nausicaä displays these three traits throughout the film with her willingness to sacrifice herself, her compassion, and her curiosity. She puts herself into dangerous situations multiple times for the sake of others, inhaling toxins to deliver instructions, standing in the way of her people who want to attack the Tolmekian, and flinging herself into the path of the Ohms. This last one actually kills her, and she is only revived by the supernatural healing powers of the Ohms as her sacrificial message calms them. This presents a far more realistic but also more appealing view of pacifism. We see that it requires just as much sacrifice as war, but it leads to more permanent and healthy resolutions, something with significant historical precedent to back it up. Miyazaki has delivered this anti-war message in a compelling way.

					<h2>Rhythm of War</h2>
					<h3>Written by Brandon Sanderson</h3>
					<p>
						The Stormlight Archive series and the wider Cosmere deal with a large array of themes, only a couple of which I will cover here. As the Rhythm of War is 1200 pages long, too, my plot summary will be fairly barebones. On the planet Roshar, organisms are able to bond spren. Spren are manifestations of people’s personification of natural forces. Wind draws wind spren, fire draws flame spren, emotions can draw spren corresponding to those emotions, and so on. Some of these spren work with animals to distort fundamental constants that would otherwise prevent them from functioning, such as helping creatures that couldn’t otherwise fly to fly. People can bond spren representing more abstract concepts. These include the spren of honour, creation, cultivation, order, secrecy, and a few others. By bonding a spren, a person becomes “Radiant”, meaning they have control over two surges or natural laws. This allows some to fly, some to become frictionless, some to mould stone, some to heal, and some to bend light. For a few, it also grants other more complex powers. The gods of this world were originally Honour and Cultivation, but then another god called Odium, who personifies intense emotions, came with the arrival of humans and shattered Honour so he essentially died. Another humanoid species, the Parshendi, lived on Roshar, but they were enslaved to Odium’s will and now must serve him. Thousands of years ago, a group called the Heralds sealed Odium away by sacrificing themselves to eternal suffering, but eventually one by one the broke, and he has returned. The humans are at war with the forces of Odium during the course of the book. The Knights Radiant are a force of Radiants spearheading the attack against Odium. There are several prominent characters whose perspectives we see. Shallan is the leader of the Lightweavers who can craft illusions and she appears to have dissociative identity disorder (DID). Kaladin was, until recently, leader of the Windrunners who can manipulate gravity. He stepped down due to battle shock. Dalinar is a Bondsmith and military leader of the Knights Radiant. He is able to see “Connections”, the physical manifestation of bonds both in the magic and regular sense. Navani is organiser and patron of the scholarly efforts of the human forces. Venli is a listener, one of the last true Parshendi not dominated by Odium. She is also the only Parshendi to have bonded a spren since Odium’s arrival.</p><p>
						Power is a key aspect of the Rhythm of War. It is dealt with both in the metaphorical sense of power as authority and the physical sense of literal power, in what we would see as magic. The blending of these two leads to some interesting narrative moments and situations. One key character from a past book, Moash, betrayed Kaladin and ran off with a stolen Shardblade (a supernaturally sharp sword). Moash had a similar state of mind to Kaladin, trying to push through the pain of PTSD and depression, and so Kaladin believes he has failed Moash once Moash leaves. In this book, Kaladin encounters him again, and discovers he’s given his emotions and soul over to Odium. This only leads to Kaladin blaming himself more, and Moash begins to permanently occupy his mind. Later on in the book, as Odium is trying to find a way to get Kaladin out of the way, he utilises this connection. Through Moash, Odium begins to plague Kaladin with extremely realistic nightmares of his worst fears come to life. Here we see a transition from the emotional power Moash held, to the actual magical power this allows him to utilise as he tries to get Kaladin to give up. Vulnerable situations in the Rhythm of War almost always seem to fall into emotional vulnerability or the vulnerability of having their Radiant powers stripped away. The tower that the Radiants dwell in, Urithiru, contains an enormous slumbering spren who gets slowly corrupted once the forces of Odium invade. Being conscious, we see the mental state of the spren get worn down slowly as the defences of the tower are turned upon themselves. The Oathpact, the agreement the Heralds formed to seal Odium, was also based upon emotional foundations that led to the physical binds. By allowing themselves to be sealed away on Braize and withstanding torture, the Heralds in turn blocked Odium from escaping and having influence. Often the Heralds would cave in mentally, which would let out Odium and the souls of the Fused, and lead to carnage on Roshar. Eventually, they discovered that one of their number never breaks, so they tied the Oathpact to him. This betrayal led to it being permanently shattered once this Herald broke down, in parallel with his bonds to the others breaking down so none of the trust required was present. Direct connections and parallels between the natural and supernatural seem to be a narrative device that Brandon Sanderson relies on greatly. This may be because, by drawing these similarities, we the readers are able to better comprehend the tones and ideas Sanderson is trying to put across. Mundane things are far more familiar to us than the rules of invented magic, so it makes sense for the invented magic to be explained in terms of mundane things.</p><p>
						Rhythm of War also incorporates neurodivergence and mental illness into its plot heavily. A common theme throughout Sanderson’s Cosmere universe is that his magic system requires individuals to have minds “closer to the spiritual realm” whether through warping or natural ability. This means that the majority of the main characters deal with mental issues over the course of the book. Kaladin expresses signs of PTSD and depression. He sets up a support group for others with similar issues after seeing the poor treatments and solutions currently in place, and the methods he uses lead to a recovery and development of his character throughout the book as well as learning what he can and can’t change. Kaladin’s advice is reflective of general modern medical consensus for dealing with depression, and this transition from the poor methods used by the priest-doctors to these modern methods also bear a resemblance to a change in our own world. It reflects the general trend away from locking the mentally ill away in what are essentially prisons, to a humane and understanding approach that involves two-way communication. It could also be seen as Sanderson attempting to give useful advice on how to deal with depression through his writing. The other significant character in this general theme is Shallan, who exhibits signs of plurality, commonly diagnosed and categorised as dissociative identity disorder (DID). Shallan’s character does well in breaking the “murderous person with multiple personalities” trope which appears almost always when such people are depicted. Instead, each of Shallan’s facets are both independent and cooperative. Decisions are also made collectively. They each hone skills relevant to the various situations Shallan experiences, and function as an emotional defence mechanism as she grapples with her past. From those who I’ve talked to and read the writing of, this origin and situation is far more accurate for plural people (people with DID) than most others have been. Different facets of their identity are often allocated specific roles, especially as DID is most frequently caused as a mechanism in response to trauma. The one issue with this depiction is the eventual conclusion, where Shallan’s personalities are integrated back together, something that has been said to have adverse and traumatic effects on those who experience it.

					<h2>On Nightfall</h2>
					<h3>Written by Isaac Asimov<br>First written in 1941, re-released in novel form with Robert Silverberg in 1990</h3>
					<p>
						Nightfall is a short novel with a unique premise. Here on Earth, one of the constants of life that we are used to is the rotation of Earth as it goes around the Sun. This results in a distinct day-night cycle. We are therefore under the cover of darkness a significant portion of the time. On Kalgash, the planet Nightfall is set on, this does not happen. Kalgash is in the midst of a large star cluster, causing six suns to be present in its sky, drowning out both darkness and the light of any stars. The inhabitants of Kalgash therefore regard darkness as something unnatural and have all grown up with a dislike and discomfort for it, much like a cave-dwelling creature might regard light. Darkness has a profound effect on those exposed to it, something demonstrated at the very start of the story by the Tunnel of Mystery. The Tunnel of Mystery is a theme park ride present at Kalgash’s equivalent of a World’s Fair. It’s a fifteen minute ride on a straight rail through a dark tunnel. Two people have died from shock after going through it, with many more being driven somewhat insane. Later, it’s revealed that a celestial body dubbed Kalgash Two previously unseen by the poor quality telescopes of the Kalgashians (as they have to deal with constant light and only have six suns to look at) is going to eclipse the smallest sun while the other five are on the other side of the planet, something that occurs every 2000 years. This will lead to a 12-hour period of darkness as the shadow of the eclipse moves with the rotating planet. This finding also confirms the core belief of the Apostles of Flame, who claim that every “Year of Godliness” (a period lasting the same as the orbital period of Kalgash Two) the denizens of Kalgash are found to be sinful and the gods strike them down with flame.</p><p>
						The core idea to be explored in Nightfall is that of superstition. It is present in the teachings of the Apostles of Flame, the fear of darkness, and the content of the reactions to this darkness. A twelve-hour period of darkness itself has no real negative physical impact, as demonstrated by our own planet, but the fear and irrational responses have severe impacts. Archaeological digs discussed at the beginning of the book reveal, with a little thought, that civilisation has been burnt greatly on previous occasions as a result of the darkness. A “layer of ash” is found separating layers of past settlements, with each built one on top of the other. This evidence of fire consistently scorching the planet is now, however, because of the gods’ wrath but because of the irrational fear of the Kalgashians. When exposed to darkness, they attempt to do anything to bring back the light, including burning everything they can. This superstition leads to the deaths of many due to a truly harmless phenomenon. It rings of the actions of those we would call Luddites and conspiracy theorists. When their worldview is upended, they respond violently despite there being no reason to. This fear of darkness, much like the fear of the Luddites, is not entirely unfounded, however. The Luddites were afraid of their skills in weaving and sewing becoming obsolete with the use of textile machinery, and this was very much the case, with many losing jobs and livelihoods. Similarly, the citizens of Kalgash have never experienced extended darkness in their lifetimes and it does have a genuine impact on their sanity. They are right to be afraid of losing their minds. The problem in both cases comes along when the beleaguered parties attempt to solve things. The Luddites destroyed the textile machinery instead of encouraging other textile workers to strike and protest, which led to them being branded as backwards and needlessly destructive. The Kalgashians burnt their surroundings and dismissed the warnings of the scientists instead of preparing, which led to the collapse of their society. This was not entirely because of a lack of reason, though. The second impact superstition had was in preventing this preparation, and here the superstition was the other way around. The Apostles of Flame were the most prominent public group claiming that darkness would arrive up until the discoveries of the scientists at Saro University. The Apostles had genuine evidence from the previous nightfall, but being a fundamentalist religious cult, they used it to claim that the gods had ordained this. The public therefore associated the concept of nightfall with cults and fanaticism. A similar tendency to associate ideas and symbols is apparent to us too, which is why “optics” is even a concern of political movements in the first place. Obvious superstition drove people away from preparing, and then personal superstition drove people to endanger themselves.</p><p>
						I have yet to discuss one of the key impacts on the minds of the Kalgashians. Once the light of the suns dropped away, the stars were revealed. Stars are marked as dangerous and insanity causing by the Apostles, but it is unclear why this would be until they actually appear. They demonstrated to those on Kalgash that their universe was far larger than they imagined. Existentialism is often discussed by philosophers, but it is also often mentioned that we cannot really grasp our true insignificance in relation to the universe. All the metaphors and examples in the world are only reframing what we already know. Having your relation to the rest of the cosmos suddenly revealed would be quite a different experience. This is something that Douglas Adams plays upon in his book The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. In this book is a mechanism known as the “Total Perspective Vortex”. This machine is a torture – or more accurately punishment – device that can extrapolate the universe from a slice of a cake. You step into the machine, comprehend the scale of the universe, and then go insane. We of course have no way of recreating this, but to people on a planet where they’ve never seen the stars, suddenly having them revealed would have a similar effect. The sane survivors in Nightfall were the scientists who were already guessing that there might be more out there and the people who didn’t look up. We know this reality on an analytical level, similarly to how we know about death, but we can’t truly comprehend it. Those schools of philosophy who accept the notion of our insignificance always add a caveat. Nihilists think nothing matters, so they are freed from worry about the significance of their actions. Absurdists know there is no meaning to life but they think that we should search for it anyway. We can’t truly come to terms with these ideas, and if we did, we’d go insane, and our civilisation would fall like that of Kalgash. As Douglas Adams writes after discussing the Total Perspective Vortex, “if life is going to exist in a universe of this size, then the one thing it cannot afford to have is a sense of proportion.” It’s very easy to be smug and cocky about our own reactions to darkness. We wouldn’t be stupid enough to lose it because the lights went out, we say. But this belief misses the true horror in Nightfall; the sudden upending of a constant lived with for generations, and then the almost comical attempt by the universe and ourselves to pretend that that never happened.

					<h2>On Piranesi</h2>
					<h3>Written by Susanna Clarke</h3>
					<p>
						Piranesi is the name of artist Giovanni Battista Piranesi, most well-known for his <i>Carceri d’invenzione</i> (“Imaginary Prisons”) series of etchings. These depict vast, architecturally impossible spaces, with spikes and chains visible in the detailing. They also contain statues and people greatly diminished by their surroundings. In Susanna Clarke’s Piranesi, the protagonist and the only other living human he knows of dwell in a seemingly infinite House. This House has grand Vestibules, Halls, and Staircases which interconnect to form a massive structure. Piranesi is the name given to the protagonist by the other inhabitant, who he terms the Other. Piranesi spends his days cataloguing in great detail every feature of the House, most notably the Statues which line every wall. These Statues vary in height and depict a wide range of scenes. This, we discover, is the solidification of ideas from our real world pooling and creating their own world.</p><p>
						For half the book, Piranesi spends his days freely exploring the House, content with his life. Enough of an ecosystem is present between the flooded Lower Halls and airy Upper Halls that he can survive somewhat comfortably, with anything he can’t get provided by the Other. Piranesi feels a great sense of freedom, joy, and purpose in his existence. He learns about abstract concepts through the Statues and the geography of his world through his dedicated chronicling. His world is complex and fascinating; so much so that for some it would be overwhelming. This shifts in the second half. Piranesi discovers that the world that birthed his own is real, that he is from that world, and that the Other has been intentionally keeping Piranesi in the House as an agent to document it and as a prisoner. This discovery shatters Piranesi’s psyche, so much so that he regards Piranesi and Matthew Rose Sorensen (his real name) to be two different people in the same body. He also begins to think of his situation as one of imprisonment, where he is trapped and at the mercy of the Other. Notably, this drastic shift is not caused by his direct discovery of the real world but simply by the re-reading of his first journal. This knowledge had been forgotten due to the House’s effects on the mind. Therefore, this shows us how relations of power, both in this world and ours, are defined on the knowledge and beliefs of those participating in the relation. The Other had no power to cause fear or anger in Piranesi until Piranesi was aware of the prisoner-captor dynamic. Piranesi did not consider himself a prisoner, as he had total freedom, until he discovered a freedom he didn’t know he was missing. In this way, power shifted. We can see the same occur in our own world. By the re-framing of disparity in wealth as the development of a meritocracy, those trapped in such a system instead take the view that capital is directly tied to skill, removing concerns about inequality. When relationships with power given to statehood or capital are instead framed as the terms of a “social contract”, those giving up their autonomy view it as an educated choice they have consciously made rather than a condition of their birth. Augustus Caesar spoke of “bread and circuses” being all that’s needed to subdue an oppressed populace, but if the populace believes that they ought to be in this oppressed state, bread and circuses become rewards. Equally, we can see the same mental convulsions when this belief that has become a firm reality is shown to be transient or false. This is obvious in the constant tendency for oppressed lower classes to revolt once they realise their situation. The most notable examples of this would be the waves of anti-monarchist revolution in Europe, which suddenly and violently deposed the previous rulers of European countries once it was realised their rule was not based on any will on wish of those they governed.</p><p>
						Interestingly, both the original artist Piranesi and the book Piranesi chose to depict their vast, surreal worlds at two removes. The material is separated from the reader first by the veil of fiction and secondly by mediums that are clearly representative rather than a direct depiction. Rather than choosing to use image collages or painting, both of which Piranesi could have done, he chose to use engraving, in which we can clearly see that this is a false, constructed world. Susanna Clarke chose to use text, trapping imagery behind a layer of prose. This should serve to make these worlds less unique and surreal by making their artifice obvious, but this doesn’t seem to be the case. Mediums which by their nature cannot show the full scale of their subject matter allow the vastness of these worlds to be accentuated all the more by the readers imagination. Much like Piranesi obscures and diminishes architecture into the distance to show how massive it is, Susanna Clarke describes only small parts of the House and hints at the rest to convey a sense of insignificance of the viewer by comparison. The character Piranesi’s own quest in the book further strengthens this image. He has travelled “as far as the Nine-Hundred-and-Sixtieth Hall to the West, the Eight-Hundred-and-Ninetieth Hall to the North and the Seven-Hundred-and-Sixty-Eighth Hall to the South” but has yet to “see any indication that the World was coming to an End”. Were this to be depicted with photo manipulation or film, where we could see the edges of the frame, we could also see that the author had depicted all of the world that existed in their mind. By limiting scope and still hinting at space beyond, we know there is more to these worlds that go up to and past the writer’s work or ideas.
