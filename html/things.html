<h1>Things I've made</h1>
<h2>I'd like to make many more things, but here's some of those I have made so far</h2>
<h3>Design for the lovely Ashenov</h3>
<p>I've enjoyed making the album art and additional designs for <a href="https://twitter.com/ComradeAshenov">Ashenov's</a> <a href="https://ashenov.bandcamp.com/album/annihilation-operator">Annihilation Operator</a> and <a href="https://ashenov.bandcamp.com/album/creation-operator">Creation Operator</a> albums. I hope I can make more similar things in the future, it's really fun working with a friend, especially one as talented as Ash! I also made a very frenetic visualiser version of the album art, which I sadly can't find. It was enjoyably mad though, I mapped the bass, mids, and treble separately to the hue, saturation, and lightness. I've spent many years in the Photoshop trenches doing random things, so it's nice to actually put that to use sometimes.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP-_EtbaawCWy6CygQd61SwUAtOjKBUgQ">Fan edits</a></h3>
<p>I've made about 70 fan edits of streams by Grayfruit and Lark. These are of varying quality, in my opinion, and I'm certainly more proud of some than others. In terms of sheer time invested, though, they're by far my largest undertaking in actually making something. My favourites are probably the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_D-k9oykDc">Wario</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU1aUAaFTIE">Doom</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L020SFW-Gzc">NSMB</a> videos.<a class="footnote"><sup>1</sup><span>based on the view numbers, youtube likes them too, which is at least a little nice.</span></a> I'm in general more proud of videos that take in multiple streams and really squish them to pull out the bits I like most. I feel like that offers more opportunities for editing jokes and expressing my own style.</p>
<h3>Editing for Grayfruit (and hopefully others go on contract me please go on you know you want to)</h3>
<p>In a happy turn of events, my large amount of fan edits led to Grayfruit contracting me to do, so far, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKCvzAF_lmE">four</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-s49uMvwD8">videos</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT5fBWWEwvE">for</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHG5GjjwdJI">the</a> main channel. This is in part a happy turn of events because three of the four videos are in that preferred multi-stream style I mentioned, which I gather is a bit of a pain in the ass to do oneself but which I love.</p>
<h3>Myriad editing gags</h3>
<p>Most of which I no longer have because I threw out the project files and videos! Argh! I really liked some of them though, and have made one rather polished one which I can't show because it has people I know IRL in it. Whoops...</p>
<h3>This website</h3>
<p>Surely I can count this?</p>
<h3>Other things</h3>
<p>I have a sadly quite bad memory so I'm sure I'm forgetting a bunch. Now it just looks like I'm trying to pad out the page length. Oh dear. I am legitimately sure there's things I've made that I've either forgotten or abandoned, though.</p>
