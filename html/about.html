	<h1>About the site</h1>
	<h2>Answers to questions you may have</h2>
	<p>Q: Is this site finished?<br>A: Very much not, but I at least have the format laid out. Now I need to populate it with far more text.</p>
	<p>Q: What's this place for?<br>A: This site is intended to serve as a place for me to link to and write about all the stuff I may make or do. Making a website has a lot more freedom of design than social media, and also means I know it's not about to vanish so long as I keep the site online.</p>
	<p>Q: Why's it look like this?<br>A: I'm kind of a sucker for clean design, it's consistent with my other recent things, and I like this colour. Originally I wanted it to look like this because I thought it would look funnily harsh, but it doesn't really... It's also pretty easy to mark-up something this simple, which is useful as I'm only just getting back into figuring out how all this works.</p>
	<p>Q: What assets does it use?<br>All the fonts on the main pages are from the Univers font family. Anything else is made by me, at present, with the exception of one side page. That page uses the font Glass Antiqua and the header uses a looping background from <a class="line" href="https://cinni.net/web.html">this site<a/></p>
	<p>Q: Why's there no navbar or home button?<br>A: God gave us the back button for a reason. Also I'm not sure how to make one that would satisfy me aesthetically, for now.</p>
	<p>Q: What happened to the previous iteration of this site?<br>A: I was unsatisfied with the layout and design of that site, so I scrapped it and made this one.</p>
	<p>Q: Who are you?<br>A: That one's a bit deep. I tried to answer it <a class="line" href="gexuma">here</a> though if you missed the link.</p>
