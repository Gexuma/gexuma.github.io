<h1>Reviews</h1>
<h2>My evaluatoryish thoughts on a number of things</h2>
<h3>What's this?</h3>
<p>Sometimes I have opinions on the things I interact with.<a class="footnote"><sup>1</sup><span>geez, that's a bit insufferable</span></a> I like the idea of structuring some of these thoughts as reviews, because it gives a very clear and recognisable structure to them. I have my suspicions that this section may end up like a bit of a blog, but I want to try sticking to the format for fun.</p>

<h3>"Botanic" tonic in a gin and tonic</h3>
<p>Don't try it, it's not worth it and you'll regret having bought it. Tonic is already flavoured enough, with extra herbs and whatnot it just ends up overwhelming the gin and creating a very confused mixture. I drank this too long ago to give a full description, so this is now just a PSA.</p>
